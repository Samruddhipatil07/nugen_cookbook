## Using Your API Key

To make actual API calls, you’ll need a free API key from Nugen:
1. Go to [nugen.in](https://nugen.in) and sign up.
2. Find the **Developer / API** section.
3. Generate your API key.
4. Replace the placeholder key in the code with your own:
```python
api_key = "your_actual_api_key_here"
```
